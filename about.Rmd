## About

I am an FSP statistician at Phastar, currently working at Takeda in preclinical and nonclinical vaccines.

My research interests are in adaptive trial designs, that incorporate bayesian inference sampling methods for parameter estimation. I have also become interested in statistical methods for non-linear models such as auto differentiation for parameter estimation. 

I earned my M.S. in Biostatistics from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston - School of Public Health, and earned my B.S. in Mathematics from North Carolina State University. I am currently working on a certificate in Applied Bioinformatics at UCSD Extended Studies.
